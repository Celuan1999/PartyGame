Title: Ball bounce, the goal is to prevent the ball from touching the ground and having the timer expire after ten seconds

Mechanics: The main mechanic is the physics of the ball and the paddle interacting with each other.

Basic Requirements: The game is in Unity 2D, its single player, it is playable with the keyboard, the game takes no more than 10 seconds to complete while having 2 second intro & outro padding, there is both a text & audio announcement during the transitions, the goal is very self-explanatory everyone has played pong & should be instantly familiar with the concept, the endgame state lasts two seconds & self terminates, my game is not a clone of a Unity tutorial.

Audio Requirements: My game has loyalty free background music by Kevin Macleod, the game also has an announcement audio that is loyalty free from Pixabay, game also features a hooray and boo sound effect also, from Pixabay, game has a ball bouncing sound effect.

Visual Requirements: I made my own background which I am VERY proud of since the doge is very happy and in high spirits that you are playing his favorite game, the sprites I made myself inside the engine that were very simplistic as it matched the game and the criteria never asked for intricacy, I also added a rudimentary particle effect to the ball, the timer UI is present in the top right counting down.
